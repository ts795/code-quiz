# Code Quiz
This project is a timed multiple choice quiz for Javascript questions. The user has 60 seconds to answer 5 questions. If the user answers a question correctly, they receive 10 points. If they answer a question incorrectly then 10 seconds are deducted from the timer. Once the user completes the quiz, they can enter their initials to save their score. A list of high scores can also be viewed. This project was implemented using Javascript timers and local storage.
